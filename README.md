# Draw-It-v1

Early working (still buggy) version of Draw It! application. I developed this during my senior year as my May term project. Developed in less than 2 weeks.

This application was briefly on Google Play store. Since then, I have taken it down becuase I'm working on a version 2 of this application. Version two can be found here: https://github.com/fruitbraker/Draw-It-v2

Additionally, I lost the security key needed to sign the APK, so this working package directory is essentially gone forever. Oops. Rookie mistake.

Special thanks to CloudMine for allowing me to use their awesome serveice to host everything. Without their support and backend processing, this application would not have happened.


If you download this project and try to run it, it will not work. The API keys are disabled for security reasons.
